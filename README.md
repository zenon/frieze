## Some Words

Operation
: Something you do to an ornament that could, in principle, change it. Like, rotating it 180Â°, or shifting it by 1 meter. Mathematicians count "don't do anything to the ornament" among the operations - it is called the identity operation.

Symmetry operation of an ornament
: An *operation*, that "changes" this ornament into itself. The identity operation is always a symmetry operation, if not an interesting one.
